# Advent of Hardcaml 2025

My attempts at solving [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/)
challenges in Hardcaml. This is a follow-up to my attempt [last
year](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-hardcaml-2024/) where I solved a
handful of challenges; this year's goal being to get as close as possible to
100% completion by the end of December.

**Do you think this is cool and want to try it for yourself?** We're running an
[Advent of FPGA
Challenge](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/) where
you can try your own designs, show off the features of your favorite HDL
languages, and win some prizes!

## Implementation

I'm primarily targeting the ULX3S FPGA board, with the Lattice ECP5-85F FPGA
chip, mostly for it's compatibility with the open-source yosys+nextpnr
toolchain.
